# Cultural Calibration Development Guide

## Introduction

This guide helps communities develop cultural calibrations for the Rose Glass framework. A cultural calibration is a lens through which the Rose Glass perceives patterns in human expression, tailored to specific cultural contexts.

**Important**: Never create calibrations for cultures you're not part of without deep, sustained collaboration with members of that community.

## Core Principles

### 1. Community Collaboration
- Calibrations must be developed WITH communities, not FOR them
- Involve multiple perspectives from within the community
- Acknowledge internal diversity - no culture is monolithic
- Credit all contributors appropriately

### 2. Avoiding Harm
- No stereotyping or essentializing
- Avoid "exotic" or "othering" language
- Don't create hierarchies between calibrations
- Respect privacy and consent throughout

### 3. Embracing Complexity
- Cultures are dynamic, not static
- Multiple calibrations can exist for the same culture
- Context matters - specify when calibrations apply
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties

## Calibration Parameters

Each calibration requires setting several parameters that affect how patterns are perceived:

### 1. Biological Constants
```python
km: float  # Moral saturation constant (typically 0.1 - 0.5)
ki: float  # Moral inhibition constant (typically 0.5 - 1.2)
```
- **km**: Lower values mean moral/emotional energy saturates quickly
- **ki**: Higher values mean stronger inhibition of extreme moral activation

### 2. Coupling Strength
```python
coupling_strength: float  # How variables interact (typically 0.05 - 0.3)
```
- Higher values mean stronger interaction between wisdom and moral energy
- Lower values mean dimensions operate more independently

### 3. Expected Patterns
```python
expected_patterns: Dict[str, str]
```
Not requirements, but patterns commonly seen:
- `reasoning`: How arguments typically flow
- `moral_expression`: How values are communicated
- `social_architecture`: Individual vs. collective emphasis
- `wisdom_integration`: How knowledge is synthesized

### 4. Breathing Pattern
```python
breathing_pattern: str  # Rhythm of communication
```
Examples:
- "sustained arguments with brief acknowledgments"
- "rapid exchange with emoji punctuation"
- "circular return to key themes"
- "long pauses for contemplation"

## Development Process

### Step 1: Community Engagement
1. Identify community partners and advisors
2. Establish consent and collaboration agreements
3. Discuss goals and concerns
4. Plan development timeline

### Step 2: Pattern Research
1. Collect examples of communication (with consent)
2. Identify recurring patterns and themes
3. Note variations and contexts
4. Document cultural values and norms

### Step 3: Parameter Mapping
1. Map observed patterns to Rose Glass parameters
2. Test different parameter values
3. Validate with community members
4. Iterate based on feedback

### Step 4: Implementation
```python
from rose_glass_v2 import CulturalCalibration

class YourCulturalCalibration(CulturalCalibration):
    @classmethod
    def create_your_calibration(cls) -> 'CulturalCalibration':
        return cls(
            name="Your Calibration Name",
            description="Brief description and context",
            km=0.25,  # Based on your research
            ki=0.85,  # Based on your research
            coupling_strength=0.12,
            expected_patterns={
                'reasoning': 'Description of typical reasoning',
                'moral_expression': 'How values are expressed',
                'social_architecture': 'Individual/collective balance',
                'wisdom_integration': 'How knowledge is integrated'
            },
            breathing_pattern="Description of communication rhythm",
            temporal_context="When this calibration applies",
            philosophical_tradition="Relevant philosophical background"
        )
```

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
1. Test with varied text examples
2. Compare results with community interpretation
3. Ensure no harmful stereotypes
4. Validate with multiple community members

### Step 6: Documentation
Create documentation that includes:
- Cultural context and background
- When to use this calibration
- Limitations and considerations
- Contributors and acknowledgments
- Examples of appropriate use

## Example: Developing a Hip-Hop Cypher Calibration

### Research Findings
- Rapid-fire wordplay with complex internal rhyme schemes
- High moral/emotional activation through social commentary
- Strong collective energy while showcasing individual skill
- Wisdom expressed through metaphor and cultural references

### Parameter Choices
```python
km=0.15  # Quick moral activation
ki=0.6   # Moderate inhibition - allows intensity
coupling_strength=0.25  # Strong wisdom-emotion coupling
breathing_pattern="Rhythmic bars with beat-matched pauses"
```

### Expected Patterns
```python
expected_patterns={
    'reasoning': 'Associative through wordplay and metaphor',
    'moral_expression': 'Direct social commentary with artistic flair',
    'social_architecture': 'Competitive collaboration - individual excellence serving collective energy',
    'wisdom_integration': 'Cultural references, samples, and callbacks to hip-hop history'
}
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Over-Generalization
❌ "All [culture] communication is indirect"
✅ "In [specific context], indirect communication is often valued"

### 2. Deficit Framing
❌ "Low consistency due to cultural limitations"
✅ "Different consistency patterns reflecting different values"

### 3. Western-Centric Baseline
❌ "Deviates from normal academic style"
✅ "Follows different conventions than Western academic style"

### 4. Static Culture
❌ "Traditional [culture] always..."
✅ "In [time period/context], [culture] often..."

## Submission Process

1. **Prepare Your Calibration**
   - Complete implementation
   - Documentation
   - Test cases
   - Community endorsement

2. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Clear description of calibration
   - Link to community consultation process
   - Include tests and documentation

3. **Review Process**
   - Technical review for code quality
   - Cultural review for sensitivity
   - Community validation
   - Integration testing

4. **Post-Integration**
   - Monitor usage and feedback
   - Update as needed
   - Maintain community connection

## Final Thoughts

Remember: Cultural calibrations are about enabling understanding across difference, not creating new forms of digital colonialism. Approach this work with humility, respect, and genuine collaboration.

The Rose Glass sees many ways of being human. Each calibration adds richness to that vision. Thank you for contributing to this diversity.
